Creating a model for the decision making process in MDD
This is the code for my Masters in Physics Disertation 'Using Dynamic Systems Theory To Model The Mind'
The model is currently a work in progress
Baesian statistics plays a heavy hand in this model with the sequential updating of parameters
This README will be updated in further detail at the end of the project, this is currently useful for my development of the model
